## Hi, my names Gabriel and I am a teacher turned programmer based in London.

I love building software that aids self expression or solves a specific problem in my life.

I work mostly with Javascript, React and Node.js to build full stack web applications. Lately I have also been picking up Ruby and Rails in my spare time.

I am currently looking for a junior developer position where I can improve my skills working alongside more experienced engineers. If you're a looking for a self-starter and value employee development then please get in contact because I think we could work well together.

### Things I am currently working on:

 - An application for generating live visuals that wraps [hydra-synth]() into an interface that's easier for me to perform with.
 - A directory of resources on [digital gardening](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). This is taking the form of a web app built to help me learn Ruby on Rails.
 - A link aggregator that pulls in items from my [pinboard](https://pinboard.in) account and makes them public. I'm using this as an opportunity to learn more about Typescript.
